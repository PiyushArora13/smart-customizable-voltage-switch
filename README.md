# smart-customizable-voltage-switch
A smart, Arduino-based voltage protection switch that monitors input voltage. When it exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 6V), the system turns off the load using an NMOS and triggers a buzzer for 3 seconds. Ideal for DIY projects needing voltage protection and alert systems.
